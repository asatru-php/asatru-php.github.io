# Installation

Asatru PHP requires composer for it to be installed, updated and dependencies managed.

Therefore first go to https://getcomposer.org/ to download and install it.

After you have installed composer, you can now use it to create a new application
with the framework by running the command:
```
composer create-project danielbrendel/asatru-php
```

Wait until Composer has finished downloading and installing the project.

Afterwards go into the created project folder and run the following command:

```
php asatru serve
```

This will launch a development web server on port 8000. You can then browse
to http://localhost:8000 and if everything went well you would see the following
welcome screen:

You are now ready to build your application!
